Radio Student (Radio Študent) is one of the first (if not first) alternative radio stations in Europe. It was established in 1969 and it's broadcasting since than. 
Radio Student is a non-profitable, urban community (culturally & socially differentiated) radio-station whose primary objective is to promote the interests of social and cultural minorities as well as the interests of the student community. And by paying attention to more complex and generally discriminated topics it also educates its own listeners. Since its very beginnings, Radio Student has promoted values such as: tolerance, respect for differences, freedom, truth, solidarity, consistent asserting of human rights, etc. The promotion of the above mentioned values is carried out at two levels: the educational, through the program (the double role of education - of authors as well as target group) and at the practical level, where Radio Student's position of difference functions as a mirror to the Slovene society. In this mirror the society can check to what extent it is ready to accept such proclaimed values in reality.
